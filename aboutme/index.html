    <h2>Brooklyn Kelsey</h2>
    <p>I'm a web design and development major and this is my third semester at BYUI. I love reading self help and fantasy books, and sewing and quilting. I got married this summer and moved to Colorado (so my last name is actually different now). I'm originally from Las Vegas NV.</p>
    <p>I've enjoyed my intro programming classes and am excited to pursue a career in web development! I think this class will be super helpful for me to learn the basics of websites. </p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is Isaiah 51:3 because it gives me hope that God can make deserts into gardens and make our trials into good things.</p>
